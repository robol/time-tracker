You just let it know the string that it should look for, and the interval that you'd like to monitor. \r\n\r\nThe software is still work in progress, so don't expect it to work flawlessly. \r\n\r\n### Building TimeTracker\r\nTo build TimeTracker you'll need Qt4, libqjson and CMake. I think that Qt5 will work as well, \r\nand you shouldn't even need libqjson in that case. \r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/robol/time-tracker\r\n$ cd time-tracker\r\n$ mkdir build && cd build/\r\n$ cmake ..\r\n$ make \r\n```"}
